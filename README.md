TODOs:
- Skeleton particle system(done)
- Figure out the likelihood function
- Add the input layer converting from the 360 camera input to a list of Observation type objects (highly nontrivial the more I think about it)
- Calibrate on the real rover
- Optimise using Numpy for the vector operations(done)
- Handle movement (basically when the rover moves, add that movement to the particles with some noise)
